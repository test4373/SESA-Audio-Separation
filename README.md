# SESA-Audio-Separation

SESA-Audio-Separation is a tool for separating audio tracks (e.g., vocals, instruments) using advanced machine learning models. This project provides a Gradio-based interface for easy audio processing.

## Getting Started

### Option 1: Clone and Run via Git
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   git clone https://github.com/test4373/SESA-Audio-Separation.git
   cd SESA-Audio-Separation
   ```

2. **Install Requirements**:
   - Git: [Download here](https://git-scm.com/)
   - Python 3.6+: [Download here](https://www.python.org/)

3. **Run the App**:
   - Place `start.bat` or 'start.sh" in the `SESA-Audio-Separation` folder.
   - Double-click `start.bat` or run it from the command prompt:
     ```bash
     start.bat
     ```
   - This script checks dependencies, installs them if needed, and starts the Gradio interface.

### Option 2: Download Locally from Releases
- Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/test4373/SESA-Audio-Separation/releases).
- Download the latest ZIP file.
- Extract it to your desired location.
- Place `start.bat` in the extracted folder and run it:
  ```bash
  start.bat
  ```
- The script will set up the environment and launch the app.

### Usage
- After running `start.bat`, access the Gradio interface at `gradio link`.

## Notes
- `start.bat` handles dependency installation and app startup. To sync with the latest GitHub changes, youâ€™ll need Git installed and can manually run `git pull origin main`.
- For GPU support, install NVIDIA drivers and CUDA.
